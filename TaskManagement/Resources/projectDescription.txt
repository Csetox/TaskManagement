Project Idea: Task Management Application

Create a task management application that allows users to add, update, and organize tasks. This project will help you practice your object-oriented programming skills and incorporate LINQ for data manipulation. Here are some key features you can include:

    Task Management: Users should be able to add, edit, and delete tasks. Each task should have a title, description, due date, and priority level (e.g., low, medium, high).

    User Accounts: Implement a basic user account system where users can register, log in, and log out. Each user should have their set of tasks that are private to them.

    Task Sorting and Filtering: Implement different sorting options for tasks, such as sorting by due date or priority. Allow users to filter tasks based on different criteria (e.g., pending, completed, overdue).

    Categories/Tags: Allow users to categorize tasks with tags or categories. Users can assign one or more tags to each task. Implement filtering and searching based on tags.

    Reminders: Implement a reminder system to notify users of upcoming or overdue tasks. You can use notifications, emails, or other means to remind users.

    Statistics and Reports: Provide users with statistics on their tasks, such as the number of completed tasks, tasks per category, or upcoming tasks. Generate reports for users to track their productivity.

    Data Storage: Use LINQ and a local database (SQLite, SQL Server Compact, or Entity Framework) to store user data and tasks persistently.

    User-Friendly GUI: Create a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for easy interaction with the application.

    Security: Ensure data security by implementing authentication and authorization features to protect user accounts and data.

    Export/Import: Allow users to export and import their task data to/from files (e.g., JSON or XML) for backup and migration purposes.

This project will give you a great opportunity to apply your object-oriented programming skills for designing and structuring your code. Additionally, you can leverage LINQ to perform data querying and manipulation, making the application more efficient and user-friendly.

As you work on this project, you can incrementally add features and gradually improve the application, making it a great learning experience and a valuable addition to your portfolio.
